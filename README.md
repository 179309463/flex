# Flex

Flex is a complete ruby client for [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org). It introduces a new way to send any kind of request (not just search queries) to the ES server, and to manage any kind of response. You can transparently integrate it with **ActiveRecord** and **Mongoid** models with or without automatic synchronization, with or without **Rails**. It is fast and efficient, easy to use and customize.

## Branches

The master branch reflects the last published gem. Then you may find a next-version branch (named after the version string), with the commits that will be merged in master just before publishing the next gem version. The next-version branch may get rebased or force pushed.
