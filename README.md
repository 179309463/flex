# Flex

Flex is a complete ruby client for [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org). It introduces a new way to send any kind of request (not just search queries) to the ES server, and to manage any kind of response. You can transparently integrate it with **ActiveRecord** and **Mongoid** models with or without automatic synchronization, with or without **Rails**. It is fast and efficient, easy to use and customize.
